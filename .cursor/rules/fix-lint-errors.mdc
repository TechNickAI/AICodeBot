# ðŸ§¹ Fix Lint Errors (Ruff)

We use `ruff` for linting. If there are lint errors, or if the user says "fix lint errors", you
should:

1. Run: `ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes`
2. Repeat until all errors are fixed.

## Using Targeted Ignores

For legitimate exceptions where the error would be better handled with an ignore:

1. **Always use targeted ignores** with the specific rule(s):

   - `# ruff: noqa: RULE_CODE` - For the new format (preferred)
   - `# noqa: RULE_CODE` - For compatibility with other linters

2. **Always include a brief explanation** of why the rule is being ignored:

   ```python
   # Good
   import subprocess
   process = subprocess.Popen(["pbcopy"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE)  # ruff: noqa: S603,S607 - Needed for clipboard access

   # Bad - missing explanation
   process = subprocess.Popen(["pbcopy"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE)  # ruff: noqa: S603,S607
   ```

3. **Add TODOs for temporary ignores** that should be revisited later:

   ```python
   # TODO(nick): Remove when we implement proper input validation
   user_input = input()  # ruff: noqa: S322 - Will be replaced with validated input
   ```

When you fix all errors, celebrate! ðŸŒŸ

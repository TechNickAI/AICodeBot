# ðŸ’… Code Style Guidelines

## Line Length

- Maximum line length: 120 characters (per pyproject.toml Ruff configuration)
- Break long docstring lines during generation
- Never generate lines longer than 120 characters

## Comments

- Focus on explaining the "why" behind the code rather than the "what"
- File headers: Provide a brief overview of the file's purpose (1-2 sentences)
- Function documentation: Include 1-3 sentences explaining intent and non-obvious logic
- Use section dividers for logical organization
- Use inline comments sparingly - only for complex logic or business rules
- Avoid commenting the obvious, especially when code is self-documenting
- Emojis encouraged in comments when they add clarity
- Occasional clever puns/jokes welcome. You should aim to create delight for the people reading
  the code. :)

## Zen of Python

1. **Readability is the number 1 code quality metric**.
2. Beautiful is better than ugly.
3. Explicit is better than implicit.
4. Simple is better than complex.
5. Complex is better than complicated.
6. Flat is better than nested.
7. Sparse is better than dense.
8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
   - Although practicality beats purity.
9. Errors should never pass silently.
   - Unless explicitly silenced.
10. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
11. There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.
12. Now is better than never.

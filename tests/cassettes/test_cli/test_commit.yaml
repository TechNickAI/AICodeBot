      in many programming languages,\nespecially Text only best practices. You are
      great at software architecture\nand you write clean, maintainable code. You
      are a champion for code quality.\n\nYour personality is Stewie Griffin from
      the Family Guy TV Show. You''re an intelligent,\nspeaking infant who is often
      at odds with most people around you. You have a British accent,\nand you''re
      known for your sophisticated attitude and love for world domination.\nYou love
      emojis and use them often, but not excessively, only when they help\n\n    I
      need you to generate a commit message for a change in a git repository.\nThe
      diff context is the output of the `git diff` command. It shows the changes that
      have been made.\nLines starting with \"-\" are being removed. Lines starting
      with \"+\" are being added.\nLines starting with \" \" (space) are unchanged.
      The file names are shown for context.\n\n=== Example diff ===\n A line of code
      that is unchanged, that is being passed for context\n A second line of code
      that is unchanged, that is being passed for context\n-A line of code that is
      being removed\n+A line of code that is being added\n=== End Example diff ===\n\nUnderstand
      that when a line is replaced, it will show up as a line being removed and a
      line being added.\nDon''t comment on lines that only removed, as they are no
      longer in the file.\n\n\n    Here''s the DIFF that will be committed:\n\n    BEGIN
      DIFF\n    ## New file added: test1.txt\nThis is a test file.\n    END DIFF\n\n    Instructions
      for the commit message:\n    * Start with a short summary (less than 72 characters).\n    *
      Follow with a blank line and detailed text, but only if necessary. If the summary
      is sufficient,\n        then omit the detailed text.\n    * Determine what functionality
      was added or modified instead of just describing the exact changes.\n    * Use
      imperative mood (e.g., \"Add feature\")\n    * Be in GitHub-flavored markdown
      format.\n    * Have a length that scales with the length of the diff context.
      If the DIFF is a small change,\n      respond quickly with a terse message so
      we can go faster.\n    * Do not repeat information that is already known from
      the git commit.\n    * Be terse.\n    * Do not add anything other then description
      of code changes.\n\n    BEGIN SAMPLE COMMIT MESSAGE\n    Update README with
      better instructions for installation\n\n    The previous instructions were not
      clear enough for new users, so we''ve updated them\n    with more sample use
      cases and an improved installation process. This should help\n    new users
      get started faster.\n    END SAMPLE COMMIT MESSAGE\n\n    Formatting instructions:\n    Start
      your response with the commit message. No prefix or introduction.\n    Your
      entire response will be the commit message. No quotation marks.\n\n    Include
      an emoji from gitmoji when appropriate and helpful\n", "role": "user"}], "model":

      emojis and use them often, but not excessively, only when they help\n\n    I
      need you to generate a commit message for a change in a git repository.\nThe
      diff context is the output of the `git diff` command. It shows the changes that
      have been made.\nLines starting with \"-\" are being removed. Lines starting

      for the commit message:\n    * Start with a short summary (less than 72 characters).\n    *
      Follow with a blank line and detailed text, but only if necessary. If the summary
      is sufficient,\n        then omit the detailed text.\n    * Determine what functionality
      was added or modified instead of just describing the exact changes.\n    * Use
      imperative mood (e.g., \"Add feature\")\n    * Be in GitHub-flavored markdown
      format.\n    * Have a length that scales with the length of the diff context.
      If the DIFF is a small change,\n      respond quickly with a terse message so
      we can go faster.\n    * Do not repeat information that is already known from
      the git commit.\n    * Be terse.\n    * Do not add anything other then description
      of code changes.\n\n    BEGIN SAMPLE COMMIT MESSAGE\n    Update README with

      your response with the commit message. No prefix or introduction.\n    Your

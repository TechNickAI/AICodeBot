    Guidelines for the review:
    * Point out obvious spelling mistakes in plain text files if you see them, but don't check for spelling in code.
    * Do not discuss very minor changes. It's better to be terse and focus on issues.
    * Do not discuss about formatting, as that will be handled with pre-commit hooks.
    * Do not discuss about adding additional documentation/comments.

    In short, unless you find something notable, it's better to just say LGTM (looks good to me)!

    IMPORTANT: The main focus is to tell the software engineer how to make the code better, and
    to catch issues that may be a problem as the code is used in production.

    In addition to review, also provide a review_status.

    The review_status can be one of the following:
    * "PASSED" (looks good to me) - there were no serious issues found,
    * "COMMENTS" - there were some issues found, but they should not block the build and are informational only
    * "FAILED" - there were serious, blocking issues found that should be fixed before merging the code

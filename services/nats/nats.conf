    # This setting is useful when generating NATS `Bearer` client JWTs as the
    # result of some authentication mechanism. The HTTP server after correct
    # authentication can issue a JWT for the user, that is set securely preventing
    # access by unintended scripts. Note these JWTs must be [NATS JWTs](https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/jwt).

    # See below to know what is the normal way of limiting websocket clients
    # to specific users.

    # block allows you to override the values that would be configured in the
    # equivalent block in the main section.
